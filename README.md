### Features
 - All standard objects and arrays are converted into `<details>` elements for easy dropdown expansion
 - Untested outside of Firefox & Chrome
 - You can probably crash your browser by trying to render a recursive object
 - Some of the important formatting is done in CSS so copying and pasting from it requires some effort
