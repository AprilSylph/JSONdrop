# JSONdrop
A JSON renderer for modern web browsers.
### Features
 - All standard objects and arrays are converted into `<details>` elements for easy dropdown expansion
 - It doesn't work in Edge (yet)
 - You can probably crash your browser by trying to render a recursive object
 - Some of the important formatting is done in CSS so copying and pasting from it requires some effort
